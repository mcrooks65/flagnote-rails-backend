# FlagNote (Rails API)

The purpose of this application is to provide easy note-taking and suggestions when doing Capture the Flag hacking events or simple pentesting.

As opposed to just a blank notepad, FlagNote is designed to suggest activities to the user and help complete a ctf event or pentest faster.  
These suggestions can be as simple as checklists, commands to try, links to info on particular topics etc.

## Installation

This is the backend api for the FlagNote application, the frontend can be found here: https://github.com/mcrooks65/flagnote-react-redux-frontend

## Usage

Start this backend Rails API using 'rails s -p 3001'.  (Note that it should be running on port 3001 to work with the frotend properly in its current configuration.)

Once the rails server has started use the link in the previous section to set up the react-redux frontend.
