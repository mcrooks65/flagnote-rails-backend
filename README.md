# flagnote-rails-backend

This is the repository for the 'React Redux Portfolio Project' at Flatiron School.  

This is the backend api for the FlagNote application, the frontend can be found here: https://github.com/mcrooks65/flagnote-react-redux-frontend

The purpose of this application is to provide easy note-taking and suggestions when doing Capture the Flag hacking events or simple pentesting.
As opposed to just a blank notepad, FlagNote is designed to suggest activities to the user and help complete a ctf event or pentest faster.  
These suggestions can be as simple as checklists, commands to try, links to info on particular topics etc.
